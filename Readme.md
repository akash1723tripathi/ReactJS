Learning React JS

//Lecture 1 -- CREATE A REACT PROJECT
//creation through **create-react-app utility** 
1) To create react project we use    "npx create-react-app --name of project--"
      require a lot of time -- old method 
      create-react-app -- it is an bulky utility and gives a lot of extras things 

2) As just you created a react app, first step is to look for package.Json to understand 
      everything 

3) Further, now check that you are in yout project file in terminal --- \01basic_react>
      command -- dir -- check the project is showing the package.json file  
      command -- npm run start
      command -- npm run build --creates a deploy ready environment fro development 
                                 inside the static folder you can all the css js file that has been written in react converted. 
                                 one time generate hota hai..  

4) For constructing project via (vite)-- basic bundler used to create project
      **npm create vite@latest**

      --dependencies-- sirf do hoti--react/react-dom
      --devDependencies-- jayda hoti hai yeh devlopoment me use hoti hai but production me nhi 
                        jati

      --isme node modules nhi hote--
      direct run nhi hota hai, node modules add karne hote hai.
      npm install 

5) Now we start we trim and tweking the files.
   Most of the time sirf src folder me kaam karna hai-- sab uda di aur index aur app js left
   --yeh basic_react wala tha

6) Now moving to vite--ud diya sab and left     
   with app.jsx and main.jsx
